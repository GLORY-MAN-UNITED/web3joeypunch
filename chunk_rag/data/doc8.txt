Regulation & Compliance 

Regulatory frameworks shape the crypto industry and influence innovation.  In the United States, multiple bills were proposed in 2025 to clarify oversight.  The Greater Enforcement in Network Inventory and Uniform Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act targets stablecoin issuers.  It requires them to hold reserves equal to tokens issued (1:1 backing), make monthly disclosures about holdings, register as insured depository institutions and comply with Bank Secrecy Act and anti–money laundering (AML) rules ￼.  The GENIUS Act would limit stablecoin issuance to banks and qualified institutions, seeking to protect consumers while fostering innovation.

Another U.S. bill, the Cryptocurrency Legal Authority for Regulation and Investment in Technology (CLARITY) Act, attempts to divide jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  It would require cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges to register with federal regulators, implement robust KYC/AML measures and disclose information to clients ￼.  The act also clarifies that certain crypto assets are commodities rather than securities, which could reduce regulatory uncertainty.  A third proposal, the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance State Act, seeks to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) without Congressional approval, highlighting privacy concerns and fears of government control ￼.

In Europe, the Markets in Crypto‑Assets (MiCA) regulation aims to harmonize rules across the European Union.  According to an Investopedia overview, MiCA entered into force in June 2023 and will be fully applicable by December 2024.  It creates a licensing regime whereby crypto‑asset service providers can operate across the EU by registering with national authorities ￼.  MiCA classifies crypto assets into categories such as asset‑referenced tokens (e.g., tokens pegged to a basket of assets), e‑money tokens (stablecoins pegged to a single currency) and other crypto assets.  Issuers must publish whitepapers describing the project, disclose risks and meet capital and governance requirements.  MiCA focuses on investor protection, market integrity and financial stability, and includes rules on marketing communications and reserves for stablecoins ￼.

Regulations vary globally.  Some countries have embraced crypto innovation, granting licences for exchanges and regulatory sandboxes, while others have imposed outright bans.  Regulators must balance innovation, consumer protection and financial stability.  Clear rules may encourage institutional adoption, but overly restrictive measures could drive projects offshore.  Compliance requirements—KYC/AML, tax reporting, capital reserves—will shape how exchanges, DeFi protocols and token issuers operate.  Understanding the regulatory landscape is thus critical for developers, investors and entrepreneurs.
