Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to financial services built on public blockchains using smart contracts to eliminate intermediaries such as banks and brokers.  A G2 learning guide notes that DeFi platforms allow users to lend, borrow, trade and earn interest using programmable money without relying on centralized institutions ￼.  Transactions are executed by open‑source smart contracts, which hold and transfer assets according to rules agreed upon in code.  Because no entity has custody of funds, users maintain control of their assets and interact directly with protocols.  DeFi protocols typically settle transactions in minutes and operate 24/7, offering high accessibility.

The building blocks of DeFi include the blockchain network itself, smart contracts that automate financial logic, digital assets (coins or tokens) representing value, and open protocols that allow composability ￼.  DeFi removes the need for traditional financial intermediaries; loans and trades are executed directly between users via liquidity pools or peer‑to‑peer lending markets.  Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap facilitate swaps by allowing users to deposit token pairs into a pool; prices are set by an algorithm based on supply and demand.  Lending protocols such as Aave or Compound enable borrowers to deposit collateral and borrow assets, paying interest to lenders who supply liquidity.  Yield farming and liquidity mining incentivize participants to provide liquidity by offering token rewards, though these returns can be highly volatile.

According to the G2 article, DeFi platforms in 2025 handle billions of dollars in transaction volume every day ￼.  Benefits include transparency (transactions and code are publicly auditable), permissionless access (anyone can use DeFi with a wallet), and potential for higher yields than traditional bank accounts ￼.  However, DeFi introduces risks: smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to hacks and loss of funds, and protocols are still experimental.  Impermanent loss affects liquidity providers when asset prices change relative to each other, and market volatility can quickly erode collateral values, leading to liquidations.  Because users retain control of their wallets, they bear full responsibility for security; losing a private key can mean permanent loss of funds.

DeFi also intersects with regulatory concerns.  Many DeFi protocols operate without clear jurisdiction, raising questions about KYC/AML compliance.  As governments formulate policy, some regulators propose requiring DeFi projects to register or restrict access in certain countries.  Despite these challenges, DeFi continues to expand into derivatives, insurance and even decentralized autonomous organizations that coordinate financial services through community governance.  Understanding DeFi’s architecture and risks is critical for participants and regulators alike.
