Web3 Concepts 

Web 3.0 (Web3) is envisaged as the third generation of the World Wide Web.  According to an Investopedia overview, Web3 is a vision of a decentralized and open internet that provides greater utility to users than today’s Web 2.0 ￼.  Whereas Web 2.0 relies on centralized platforms (like social media companies) and monetizes user data, Web3 aims to give users control over their data and to distribute power across participants rather than a few corporations.  Core features of Web3 include decentralization, trustlessness, permissionless participation, integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and ubiquitous connectivity ￼.  Information in Web3 is stored based on content rather than a fixed location; data may reside on multiple nodes, breaking the monopoly of corporate databases ￼.  Because Web3 protocols run on public blockchains, applications are trustless (no intermediary required) and permissionless (anyone can participate) ￼.

A signature Web3 component is the decentralized application (dApp).  A dApp runs on a blockchain or peer‑to‑peer network, operates without a central authority and uses smart contracts to coordinate user interactions ￼.  DApps promise improved user privacy, censorship resistance and security because no single entity can alter or shut down the application ￼.  However, they also face scalability issues, difficulties in updating code and potential security risks ￼.  Examples of dApps range from decentralized finance protocols to social media platforms and decentralized file storage.  Underneath these applications are smart contracts that automatically execute business logic when conditions are met, enabling peer‑to‑peer transactions without reliance on centralized servers.

Web3 also introduces decentralized identity (DID), an approach to identity management in which individuals control their credentials rather than relying on governments or corporations.  A 101 Blockchains guide explains that decentralized identity allows you to manage your digital identity without relying on a specific service provider ￼.  Digital identities include personal data such as search history, purchase history and identification numbers ￼.  DIDs, verifiable credentials and identity wallets store this information on the blockchain, giving users control over what data they share and allowing them to authenticate across services ￼ ￼.  Decentralized identity systems can improve accessibility, reduce identity theft and enable selective disclosure of information using cryptographic techniques such as zero‑knowledge proofs ￼.  These innovations support the idea of self‑sovereign identity, where users own and manage their digital credentials.

Another hallmark of Web3 is the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).  A DAO is a blockchain‑native organization whose rules and processes are encoded in smart contracts, allowing it to operate without centralized management.  Investopedia notes that a DAO is effectively a business that uses an interconnected web of smart contracts to automate all essential and non‑essential processes ￼.  The goal is not merely to reduce human input but to eliminate it entirely; in an ideal DAO, participants contribute funds or effort and vote on proposals while the smart contracts handle governance, treasury management and other operations.  DAOs promise cost‑effective and fair governance because they remove middlemen and align stakeholder interests ￼.  Real‑world DAO frameworks like DAOStack and Aragon help organizations create their own governance structures ￼.

Web3 therefore encompasses a suite of technologies – dApps, decentralized identities, wallets, DAOs and smart contracts – all underpinned by blockchain networks.  Together, these elements aim to shift power from centralized intermediaries to communities of users, promising new economic models and digital experiences while raising questions about scalability, security and regulation.
