Scaling & Infrastructure 

As blockchain adoption grows, networks must address limitations in throughput and latency.  Layer 1 (L1) refers to the base blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Cardano.  A Hacken article describes L1 as the foundational network that processes transactions and maintains consensus; it can host dependent chains and smart contracts ￼.  To scale, Layer 1 chains can optimize their protocols by changing consensus mechanisms (e.g., Ethereum’s shift from PoW to PoS), implementing hard or soft forks, or introducing sharding, which partitions the network into smaller segments that process transactions in parallel ￼.  These upgrades aim to increase transactions per second while maintaining security and decentralization.

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain and move transaction processing off‑chain to reduce congestion.  The Hacken article notes that L2 networks process bundles of transactions separately before submitting the results back to the L1 chain, enhancing throughput and lowering fees ￼.  Several L2 architectures exist:
	•	State channels allow participants to transact off‑chain, with only the final state settled on the main chain.  Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Raiden for Ethereum are examples.
	•	Rollups bundle many transactions and post compressed data to L1.  Optimistic rollups assume transactions are valid unless challenged; zero‑knowledge (ZK) rollups use cryptographic proofs to verify off‑chain computations. ￼  These rollups can significantly increase throughput while preserving security.
	•	Sidechains are separate blockchains connected to the main chain via bridges, enabling transactions to occur off‑chain with different consensus rules.
	•	Nested blockchains stack multiple layers of chains on top of each other, each handling specific functions.

Emerging approaches, such as modular blockchains, further separate blockchain tasks into distinct layers.  A 101 Blockchains guide explains that modular blockchains decouple consensus, execution and data availability into independent modules, providing flexibility and scalability ￼.  By distributing tasks across specialized layers, modular architectures improve throughput and enable developers to upgrade components independently ￼.  For instance, the consensus layer may use a different protocol from the execution layer, and data availability can be handled by a dedicated network.  Examples like Celestia and Syscoin showcase modular designs that aim to simplify blockchain development and offer regulatory compliance features ￼.

Scaling also involves cross‑chain bridges and interoperability solutions that connect multiple blockchains, allowing assets and data to move seamlessly between networks.  These bridges enable users to transfer tokens across chains and use decentralized applications regardless of their native platform.  However, bridges introduce new security risks; numerous exploits have led to multi‑million‑dollar losses.  The trade‑off between speed and security remains a central issue in scaling infrastructure.  Developers must design solutions that increase throughput without compromising decentralization or exposing users to vulnerabilities.
