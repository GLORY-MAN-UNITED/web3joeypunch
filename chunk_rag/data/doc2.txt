Cryptocurrencies & Tokens 

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography and stored on a decentralized blockchain network ￼.  Unlike fiat money issued by governments, cryptocurrencies are not typically controlled by a central authority; their supply and rules are encoded in software and enforced by participants across the network.  The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, introduced the idea of scarce digital money with a supply capped at 21 million coins.  It functions primarily as a transactional token (means of payment) and a store of value.  Other networks such as Ethereum have native currencies (ether) that pay for transaction fees and computational resources on the network ￼.  Cryptocurrencies enable peer‑to‑peer transfers without traditional intermediaries, offering advantages like quick settlement and lower fees but also suffer from price volatility and regulatory uncertainty ￼.

Cryptocurrencies fall into several token categories.  Utility tokens provide access to a platform or service; examples include ether (ETH) on Ethereum or XRP on the XRP Ledger ￼.  Transactional tokens are used as digital cash (Bitcoin is the most famous example) ￼.  Governance tokens confer voting rights on protocol decisions, such as Uniswap’s UNI token ￼.  Platform tokens (e.g., Solana’s SOL) support decentralized applications built on a specific blockchain ￼.  Security or asset‑backed tokens represent ownership of an underlying asset like real estate or company shares; they are regulated as securities in many jurisdictions ￼.  Commodity tokens are backed by physical commodities such as gold or oil.  Understanding these categories helps investors evaluate token purpose and risk.

Tokenomics encompasses the economic design of a token: supply, issuance, utility, distribution and incentives.  Many networks distribute tokens through mining (proof‑of‑work) or staking (proof‑of‑stake), rewarding participants who secure the network.  Supply models vary – some tokens have fixed supplies like Bitcoin, while others are inflationary or deflationary.  Security tokens are offered through regulated fundraising (STOs), utility tokens fuel network functions, transactional tokens pay gas fees and governance tokens allow token holders to vote on protocol upgrades.  In many networks, gas fees are paid in the native currency to execute smart contracts and deter spam.  Token burning (permanently removing tokens from circulation) is used by some projects to reduce supply and potentially increase value.

Stablecoins deserve special mention: they are tokens designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currency.  U.S. legislation proposed in 2025 (the GENIUS Act) would require stablecoin issuers to hold dollar‑denominated reserves equal to outstanding tokens, conduct monthly audits and register as insured depository institutions ￼.  Such regulation highlights the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.  Investors should understand the purpose and mechanics of any token before acquiring it and be aware of market, technological and regulatory risks.
