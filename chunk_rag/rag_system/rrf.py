rrf.py
------

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is a simple yet effective method for
combining ranked lists from multiple retrieval systems.  It assigns
each document a score based on the reciprocal of its rank (plus a
constant) in each list and sums these scores across lists.  The
document with the highest total score is ranked first in the fused
list.

This module implements a reference RRF algorithm with sensible
defaults.  It operates on lists of document identifiers and produces a
single ranked list of identifiers.  You can pass optional perâ€‘method
weights to emphasise one retrieval system over another.

    """Fuse multiple ranked lists using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

    Parameters
    ----------
    runs : sequence of sequences
        Each element of ``runs`` is a ranked list of document IDs
        returned by one retrieval method.  The first element in a
        list is considered the top document.
    k : int, optional
        The RRF constant.  Larger values reduce the influence of
        lower ranks.  Defaults to 60 as suggested in the literature.
    weights : sequence of floats, optional
        Optional weights to multiply each system's contribution.  Must
        be the same length as ``runs``.  If omitted, all systems are
        weighted equally.

    Returns
    -------
    list of (str, float)
        A list of tuples containing the document ID and its RRF score,
        sorted in descending order of score.

    Notes
    -----
    RRF is robust to noisy lists and does not require normalisation
    across systems.  It works particularly well when combining
    fundamentally different retrieval strategies (e.g. lexical and
    vector based).
